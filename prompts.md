# Prompts Log

A running log of the important prompts used during the development of CeliacMap,
with a brief description of what each one was used for.

---

## 1. Initial landing page development

**Prompt (summary):** "Read CLAUDE.md carefully. Plan the complete development of
the landing page described there, then build it."

**Used for:** Bootstrapping the entire project — defining the file structure,
color palette, typography, and the 12-section breakdown of the landing page, then
implementing `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/main.js`.

**Key decisions made during this prompt:**
- **Language:** Bilingual — Spanish (Argentina, "sin TACC") as the default copy in
  the HTML, with a client-side ES/EN toggle (no build step, no backend).
- **Typography:** Inter via Google Fonts CDN, with a system-font fallback stack.
- **Interactive Map:** A pure HTML/CSS conceptual mockup (no map library), to keep
  the project dependency-free and self-contained.
- **Icons:** Inline SVG (no icon library), themeable via `currentColor`.
- **No binary image assets:** all visuals built with CSS/SVG.

## 2. Editorial visual + content redesign

**Prompt (summary):** "Full visual and content redesign — refined deep/soft greens
on warm off-whites, Playfair Display + DM Sans, editorial/minimal aesthetic,
shorter and warmer copy. Keep structure, accessibility and the ES/EN toggle."

**Used for:** Reworking `index.html` and `css/styles.css` (and later the `js/main.js`
EN dictionary) into an editorial, lifestyle-brand look without changing the section
structure or order.

## 3. Architecture & product evolution

**Prompt (summary):** "Evolve CeliacMap from a landing page into a real functional
product. Document the approved architecture (Leaflet + Supabase + Python agents +
GitHub Actions cron), refine the schema, plan the build order, recommend AI APIs
per agent, and update CLAUDE.md / README.md."

**Used for:** Planning the product evolution and documenting it — added the
**## Architecture** section to `CLAUDE.md` and updated `README.md`'s scope, stack
and structure. No implementation code yet.

**Key decisions made during this prompt:**
- **Validator model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6`; tiered escalation to `claude-opus-4-8`
  for low-confidence cases noted as a future optimization.
- **Search / Updater:** deterministic first; `claude-haiku-4-5` only where free-text
  interpretation is needed.
- **Schema:** added `places.status` (pending/approved/discarded), provenance/dedup
  fields, and RLS so the anon key reads only approved places.
- **Phase 1 (revisitable):** auth deferred; small manual seed for Uruguay/Argentina.

## 4. Search agent (Phase 5)

**Prompt (summary):** "Proceed with Phase 5 — build `agents/search_agent.py`. Read
targets from `targets.yaml`, search the Google Places API per city + term,
deduplicate by `external_id`, insert new candidates as `status='pending'` into
Supabase, and log each run to `agent_log`."

**Used for:** Implementing the first agent — a deterministic (no-LLM) `SearchAgent`
that crosses every city in `config/targets.yaml` with every search term, maps each
Google Places result onto the `places` schema, assigns a provisional category from
the Google place types, deduplicates by `external_id`, and inserts pending
candidates for the Validator to judge.

**Key decisions made during this prompt:**
- **Deterministic search:** no LLM; category is derived by inverting the
  `categories` map in `targets.yaml` (google type → our category), defaulting to
  `restaurant` when no type matches.
- **Provisional fields at insert:** `safety_level` defaults to the most
  conservative `options_available`; the Validator sets the real category/safety.
- **Deduplication:** a per-run `seen` set on `external_id` plus the DB's unique
  `(source, external_id)` index (upsert ignores duplicates) for cross-run dedup.
- **Cost/quality guards:** permanently-closed and malformed results are skipped;
  results per query are capped by `MAX_SEARCH_RESULTS_PER_QUERY`. Per-query
  failures and a final run summary are written to `agent_log`.
